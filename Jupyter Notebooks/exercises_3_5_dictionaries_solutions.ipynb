Write a program to count the occurrences of each unique character in a string using a dictionary named `count`. You should loop through the string and add characters as keys. The values should be the number of times the character occured. At the end, you should print the dictionary. Hint: Use the `setdefault()` method to ensure that the key is in the count dictionary (with a default value of `0`) so the program doesnâ€™t throw a `KeyError` error when you first encounter the character.\n","Eg.
